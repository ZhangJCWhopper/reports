Developing or newly industrialized countries
Feeling of happiness
Introduction 
All developing and newly industrialized, I guess development would have some influence on people's happiness, so I choose these countries, and divided the targets by age.

The older generation lived a not so good life when they were young, but their life have been much better today. But in another hand, the young generation, they do not have such kind of experience, but they have learned about the happy life in the developed countries through movies, books or trips, which would make them learn that their life is not so good, and then feel unhappy. 
In addition, in the developing stage, the developing and industrization would also bring many new problems like wealth gap, pollution and so on. 
Finally, these countries all have different culture and social background, so I think analyze them would be very interesting.
